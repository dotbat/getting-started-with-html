    <h1>The Basics of Web and HTML</h1>
<hr>
<h2>WWW.</h2>
<p>
The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) documents shared across multiple computer networks. HTTP is the protocol that “unites” the web; standing for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, it allows the communication of data between these networks.
</p>
<p>
Built during the early 1990s, it is estimated that over 30 billion webpages are currently online. Many of these pages connect or link back to each other through what is known as a <a href="http://www.google.com">hyperlink</a>.
File types found on the web can vary--you’re not limited to simply HTML files.<br>
<br><b>The main parts of the web:</b><br>
  <ul><li>The user (you)</li>
  <li>The user’s machine (computer device) and web browser (Google Chrome)</li>
  <li>The Internet (communicates through HTTP)</li>
    <li>Servers (dedicated to hosting files and storing data)</li></ul>
</p>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>
HTML is essentially the language of the web. It allows you to tell a computer's browser how to display a page. It uses text-based content, markup references, and links to other web pages. The markup consists of many "<em>elements</em>" that use "<b>tags</b>" to communicate with the browser. These tags, while enclosing content, basically create formatting rules that the browser must follow. 
</p>
<p>
Elements can be inline or block. Inline elements are just text, occuring inline with surrounding elements; anchors(a) are inline. Block elements are isolated from their surroundings, as they are placed in a [box]. An example of a block element is the paragraph(p) element. Div, a container element, is an element that solely contains stuff inside itself.
</p>
<h4>An example of an element in its entirety:</h4>
    <p>
  < sample tag >Content< /sample tag >
<ul><li>opening tag consists of < ></li>
  <li>closing tag consists of < / ></li></ul>
    <br>*Real tags will not have spaces before and after the < or > symbols.
    </p>
    <p>
    
      <br><br><b>Example Tags:</b>
<pre><code>
b - bold
em - emphasis, italics
a - anchor, hyperlink
img - imaging embedding with descriptive text using alt attribute
br - line break
p - paragraph
span - inline text modifier
div - block element used to enclose content
html - an opening tag that surrounds an entire HTML document
title - title of the webpage
body - the main body content of the HTML file
head - modifies behind-the-scenes stuff, like CSS, metadata, and the title
!doctype HTML - declares to the browser that your file is HTML
</code></pre>
</p>
<br><b>Tips:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>You are allowed to nest tags</li>
<li>Void tags, like the line break don’t require content so no need to close them with < / ></li>
<li>Attributes, like the alt text attribute of the image element, modify tags, defining them</li
<tag attr=”value”></tag>
<li>Whitespace can be controlled by tags like < br > and < p ></li></ul>
